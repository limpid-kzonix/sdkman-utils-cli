#### To make it easier to review, we have these PR requirements:

    Every PR must have exactly one issue associated with it.
    Write a clear explanation of what the code is doing when opening the pull request, and optionally add comments to the PR.
    Make sure there are tests - or ask for help on how the code should be tested in the Issue!
    Keep PRs small and to the point. For extra code-health changes, either file a separate issue, or make it a separate PR that can be easily reviewed.
    Use micro-commits. This makes it easier and faster to review.
    Add a screenshot for UX changes (this is part of the PR checklist)
